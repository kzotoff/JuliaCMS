Some explanations for config items:

	"addresses" = [
		{ "default" : "test1@example.com" },
		{ "service" : "test2@example.com" }
	],
	
	These are addressees for feedbacks. one can select using "recipient" field in the form.
	For example, use such HTML in your feedback page:

	<form id="feedback_form">
		<input type="hidden" name="recipient" value="service" />
		...
	</form>
	
	so address with index "service" will receive the message.
	the first is default (even it is not named as default), if not set in the form

	
	
	
	"default_subject" : "New message from the site"
	
	Subject for the messages, if not set directly
